## Problem
we need a way to have the chicago surfshark .conf file here but not expose any sensitive credentials.

## Solution
have the .conf file locally here and then copy it over to where it needs to go to on the machine.

I think there wireguard has a way to alias multiple configurations so you can quickly tear down and standup/run different vpns.
